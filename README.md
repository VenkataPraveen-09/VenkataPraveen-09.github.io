Developed a full-stack web application utilizing JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB as the backend database. The project's primary focus was to provide users with a secure platform to create, store, edit, and delete personal notes. Each user had their individual credentials and a dedicated space to manage their notes. The application allowed users to edit every attribute within their notes, offering a seamless and personalized note-taking experience. This project showcased my proficiency in full-stack web development, including front-end design using React, back-end server setup with Node.js, and data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.
